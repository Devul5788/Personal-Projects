function out = mapFeature(X1, X2)
% MAPFEATURE Feature mapping function to polynomial features
%
%   MAPFEATURE(X1, X2) maps the two input features
%   to quadratic features used in the regularization exercise.
%
%   Returns a new feature array with more features, comprising of 
%   X1, X2, X1.^2, X2.^2, X1*X2, X1*X2.^2, etc..
%
%   Inputs X1, X2 must be the same size
%

% One way to fit the data better is to create more features from 
% each data point. In the provided function mapFeature.m, we will
% map the features into all polynomial terms of x1 and x2 up to the 
% sixth power.
